## Provide an answer, rather than directing people to an answer {#introduction}
{::comment}In this paragraph, give the user the tl;dr lowdown. {:/} 
Links can be helpful, but aren't that helpful with no context. Make sure your answer is useful even if the link goes down.

## Why this is a problem {#whythisisaproblem}
{::comment}In this section, detail why the post has problems{:/} 
Links aren't invincible. If they redirect to an external page that disappears, the link can become broken. Beside that, maybe you linked to a whole library, where the answer is explained, but OP will have to dive into it to find it. Maybe the link is just a piece of code, but OP will have to understand it by itself. You can see [Your answer is in another castle](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/225370/364344) for more information.

## Why this is worth a downvote {#whythisisworthadownvote}
{::comment}In this section, you can describe why the problem is worth a downvote within the community in which it was posted{:/}
You took a little time to find and post a link. It may be the greatest link ever, but that is still only minimal effort investing in answering the question. For answers, we expect a little more of context and information, so make your answer richer, and improve the lives of future readers.

## What to do next {#whattodonext}
{::comment}In this section, cover how the problem can be fixed.{:/}
Don't take the link out. But copy the essential parts of it into the answer. Explain how to solve the problem, or the important parts of the link to read. Leave it just for future references.

{::comment}The following paragraphs should be added as is to the bottom of all pages{:/}

Once you have done this, leave a reply to the downvote comment. They will be happy to retract their downvote.
